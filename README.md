Templum
=======


Introduction
------------

Templum is an extremely *lightweight*, *simple* yet *powerful* and *fast*
templating engine for PHP. It re-uses the power of PHP itself for rendering
templates, but provides additional features making it easier to write
templating code.  Rendering templates using Templum is very fast; it
approximates native PHP rendering speed for include() statements.


Features
--------

*   Lightweight. About 140 lines of code (excluding Â±140 lines of API comments).
*   Re-uses PHP alternative syntax for clarity and full power. (You can also use normal syntax)
*   Very fast. Renders 10,000 templates in 0.741s (Native PHP takes 0.633s).
*   I18N (translated) templates.
*   Per-session caching of rendered templates.
*   Inheritance.
*   Including other templates.
*   Security by automatic encoding of HTML entities.
*   Universal, global and local variables.
*   PHP v4 and v5 support.

The template language features the following syntax:

    {{ and }}

Echo's the variable, function or other PHP printables between the accolades. Echo'ed contents is automatically escaped using htmlspecialchars() (can be turned off).

    [[ and ]]

Start a PHP code block.

    @line

Interpret a line starting with an at-sign as a line of PHP code.


Examples
--------

The following is an example of an simple controller file. It defines some data (which really should be coming from a model and a database), creates a new Templum instance and renders a template.

**/index.php:**

    <?php

    require_once('templum.php');

    // Define some data. This might as well have come from a database.
    $username = 'jjohnson';
    $accounts = array(
       array('id'=>1, 'username'=>'jjohnson',  'realname'=>'John Johnson'),
       array('id'=>2, 'username'=>'ppeterson', 'realname'=>'Pete Peterson'),
       array('id'=>3, 'username'=>'jdoe',      'realname'=>'John Doe'),
    );

    // Create the Template engine with the base path for the templates.
    $templum = new Templum('view');

    // Set a universal variable which will be available in every template created
    // using the template engine.
    $templum->setVar('username', $username);

    // Retrieve and render a template with the data in $accounts as a local
    // variable and $username as a universal variable.
    $tpl = $templum->template('account/list');
    print($tpl->render(compact('accounts')));

    ?>

The template file called in the above example looks like this:

**/view/account/list.tpl:**

    [[
    if (!function_exists('helperBtnAction')) {
       function helperBtnAction($action, $id, $icon) {
          echo('<a href="?action='.$action.'&id='.$id.'">');
          echo('<img src="ico/'.$icon.'.png" alt="'.$icon.'" border="0" />');
          echo('</a>');
       };
    };
    ]]
    <h1>User list</h1>

    <p>Hello {{$username}}, here's a list of all the users:</p>

    <div id="accounts">
       @if (count($accounts) <= 0):
          No accounts found.
       @else:
          <table>
             <tr>
                <th>&nbsp;</th>
                <th>Username</th>
                <th>Full naam</th>
             </tr>
             @foreach ($accounts as $account):
                <tr>
                   <td>[[helperBtnAction('account.edit', $account['id'], 'edit')]]</td>
                   <td>{{$account['username']}}</td>
                   <td>{{$account['realname']}}</td>
                </tr>
             @endforeach
             <tr>
                <td>[[helperBtnAction('account.add', '', 'add')]]</td>
                <td colspan="4">&nbsp;</td>
             </tr>
          </table>
       @endif
    </div>

More examples are available in the source package or in the git repository.
