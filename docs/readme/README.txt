Templum

Templum is an extremely lightweight, simple yet powerful and fast templating
engine for PHP. It re-uses the power of PHP itself for rendering templates, but
provides additional features making it easier to write templating code.
Rendering templates using Templum is very fast; it approximates native PHP
rendering speed for include() statements.
