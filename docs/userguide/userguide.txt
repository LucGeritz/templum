About
-----

Templum is an extremely lightweight, simple yet powerful and fast
templating engine for PHP. It re-uses the power of PHP itself for
rendering templates, but provides additional features making it easier
to write templating code. Rendering templates using Templum is very
fast; it approximates native PHP rendering speed for include()
statements.

=== Features ===

- Lightweight. Only a single file; about 120 lines of code (excluding
  +/- 130 lines of API comments).
- Re-uses PHP alternative syntax for clarity and full power.
- Very fast. Renders 10,000 templates in 0.741s (Native PHP takes
  0.633s).
- Namespaces.
- I18N (translated) templates.
- Per-session caching of rendered templates.
- Universal, global and local variables.

Usage
-----

=== API ===

Templum consists of two main classes.

+TemplateEngine+::
  The +TemplateEngine+ class is the main class that facilitates templates. It
  retrieves (translated) templates from disk or cache, compiles them and then
  returns them ready for rendering as a +Template+ class instance.

+Template+::
  +Template+ class instances represent templates ready for rendering by your
  application. They are instantiated by the +TemplateEngine+ class. They handle
  the actual rendering of the template. The +Template+ class also knows how to
  handle errors in your templates, and has helper functions which can be used
  from your templates to easily include other templates and to render
  variabels.

These two classes both have their own Exception class:

+TemplateEngineException+::
  This exception is thrown by the +TemplateEngine+ class when an error occurs
  such as non-existing templates, etc.

+TemplateException+::
  This exception is thrown by the +Template+ class when errors occur in
  rendering your template. This includes PHP errors such as uninitialized
  variables. These errors are intercepted by the +Template+ class and then
  raised as +TemplateException+ exceptions.
