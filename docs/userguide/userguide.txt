About
-----

Templum is an extremely lightweight, simple yet powerful and fast
templating engine for PHP. It re-uses the power of PHP itself for
rendering templates, but provides additional features making it easier
to write templating code. Rendering templates using Templum is very
fast; it approximates native PHP rendering speed for include()
statements.

=== Features ===

- Lightweight. Only a single file; about 120 lines of code (excluding
  +/- 130 lines of API comments).
- Re-uses PHP alternative syntax for clarity and full power.
- Very fast. Renders 10,000 templates in 0.741s (Native PHP takes
  0.633s).
- Namespaces.
- I18N (translated) templates.
- Per-session caching of rendered templates.
- Universal, global and local variables.
